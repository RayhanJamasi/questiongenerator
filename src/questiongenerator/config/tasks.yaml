    Generate 10 unique internship interview questions based on {question_type}.

    Each question must use a DIFFERENT underlying focus, such as:
    - debugging
    - teamwork
    - decision-making
    - learning new tools
    - handling ambiguity
    - time management
    - technical depth
    - communication
    - ownership
    - ethical judgment

    Do NOT reuse the same core idea.
    Do NOT reword similar scenarios.

    Each question must:
    - sound like a real interview question
    - vary in difficulty
    - VERY IMPORTANT: the question can be answered EFFECTIVELY between {min_word_count}–{max_word_count} words. 

    Do NOT include explanations or numbering.
  expected_output: >
    10 distinct questions, must be one per line.
